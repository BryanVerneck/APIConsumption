# APIConsumption

A simple project using axios and express to make the frontend consume the backend api and the backend api consume another api.

Despite beeing really simple, it help me to understand better how this integration works. 

I created only two Files, they being: 

- server.js where the backend was implemented 

- index.html where the frontend was implemented with a generic html just for practice.
